# No Clutter - YouTube

This is a Firefox addon that removes YouTube's intrusive info boxes. These boxes are annoying because they push down the video's title and its buttons. I do not like scrolling past the same box over and over, and YouTube does not have its own setting to turn them off. I also do not appreciate their attempts to push " *approved* " information.

## Install
#### This addon's AMO page can be found [HERE](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/no-clutter-youtube/).
**The addon can also be installed manually:**
1. Navigate to the Firefox addon page.
   - Enter `about:addons` into your url bar and press `enter`.
   - In Firefox, use the shortcut `ctrl + shift + a` to get to the addons page.
   - Click on the menu button in the top right corner of Firefox, and then click `Add-ons` in the menu.
2. Click the gear button at the top; it's to the right of *Manage Your Extensions*.
3. Click `Install Add-on From File...`.
4. Select `no_clutter_youtube-1.0-fx.xpi`, and follow the on-screen prompts.

## Current Issues
1. Sometimes the boxes still show up in search results; refreshing the page makes them go away. I think youtube may be doing something weird with how it moves between pages on the site.
2. The extension needs the `tabs` permission to function, even though it has host permission for youtube pages.
